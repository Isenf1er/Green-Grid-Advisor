# Green Grid Advisor
This repository contains a snippet of the startup company Green Grid Advisor, formed by Calvin Li and I, in an effort to create a tool to help users save electricity and money through time of use rates data.

## About Us
Green Grid Advisor is a startup company that Calvin Li and myself, Nicholas Prakoso, created to solve the issue of high energy usage/wastage and overall help the user save money through utilization of time of use rates data. To solve this issue, we decided to develop an Android app that would allow users to enter required data for us to match to our centralized database created using real-time data provided by power authorities around the US. Ideally, our app would use the data the user input such as the state they live in and their utility company and the app would approximate savings based on the time of the current day by alerting the user the best times to use their electrical appliances since time of use rates have peak and off-peak hours where electricity costs the most and least amounts.

## App Teaser
Below is a short teaser video of the app produced in Kotlin with a more elaborate explanation to our solution. In addition, the worked developed was presented in the Equity Incubator Concept Track Fall 2023 to obtain advice for our idea and for possible startup funding.

## Web Application Version
After developing a prototype of the app, we reflected upon the various issues we encountered and decided to move forward with a website instead of an Android app. In developing the Android app, we found huge complexity issues some of which we solved, but we decided that a website would be more suitable at the moment for our project and developed an IoT style dashboard using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, ExpressJS, React, NodeJS). Below is a demo of our prototype website depicting our features and a better visualization of our real-time graphs.
